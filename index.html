                    Weight lifting<br>

                    Cardio<br>
                    Don't like lifting weights? Don't like going on long runs in the freezing cold
                    or scorching sun? Want to lose weight without having to worry about weather 
                    conditions? If this sounds like you then our gym is perfect. With good cardio
                    equipment we got you covered

                    Yoga<br>
                    Wanna learn how to do a split, be flexible and avoid random cramps. Come on down
                    and enjoy quality sessions of yoga in a peaceful and quiet environment. We have 
                    classes or you can do it on your own if you want quality time for yourself

                    Meditation<br>
                    This is an unusual one to see in a gym but we think it is essential to train 
                    your mind and be one with yourself. Your mental state is important to you and 
                    for your fitness goals. When one is at peace it is easier to achieve your goals
